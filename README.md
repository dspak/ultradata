# ultradata
This is the record of preparation and reporting for @dspak and @ajtrexler's ultra running.

### rr_class.py
race_results, a python class that parses race results with methods for displaying and eventually (?) analyzing the data in some meaningful way.   

todo:  
- plot paces 
- more options for the input data
- auto scraper for webpage with results?  on our scale probably overkill.
- output predicted finish times based on percentile finisher param
- ???
