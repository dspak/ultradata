"Pacers are allowed on laps 3 and 4, beginning at mile 53.6. Pacers may not join runners at Covered Bridge or Hickory Ridge. It is very important that pacers check in at race headquarters before heading on course to join their runner. If a pacer is joining their runner at an aid station other than Mohican Adventures, they cannot leave a car at the aid station, they must coordinate a ride to the aid station they are joining their runner at.",,,,,,,,,,
